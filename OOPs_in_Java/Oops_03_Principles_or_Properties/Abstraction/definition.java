      Abstraction -> Hiding the unnecessary details and showing only valuable information
                   for in depth check notes

         for example if we have a computer system to do our work which is happening in daily life then
         we really need to know that internal mechanism of our system that's why those informations are hiding for us
         ana this is abstraction
         It is design level issue and Encapsulation is implementation level issue this is different between both

         I think that
           Encapsulation is nothing but it is internal part of Abstraction which is hiding for users
           means whatever internally work in come in Encapsulation and Abstraction working for external thing
           ki kya dikhana hai user ko aur kya nahi to ye kya nahi wala part hi Encapsulation dwara kiya jata hai.

        Abstraction is process of gaining information and Encapsulation is process of containing information
